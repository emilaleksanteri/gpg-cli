# About
I needed a fast way to add gpg keys to repos on my machine for different email addresses, this small tool solves that for me

## Steps
1. [Generate a GPG key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/generating-a-new-gpg-key) (this not yet implemented on cli)

(FEATURES UNDER WORK ATM)

# Install
1. Copy repo to local
2. Run ```go build && go install``` now ```gpg-gen``` is part of your ```./bin/go``` path
